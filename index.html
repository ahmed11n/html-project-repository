 Every information system has a database at its core. That makes an
 understanding of database systems an essential skill for a computer
 scientist or information technologist. During the past 50 years – since its
 inception – the area of database systems has matured into a well-established,
 conventional subject. However, new ideas are continuously developed and
 new challenges and issues constantly appear. These need to be addressed
 from both a theoretical and practical standpoint. This subject can be seen as
 consisting of a ‘classic’ and a ‘young’ component. The former is based almost
 entirely on the relational model and at the time of writing still represents,
 de facto, the standard approach of most industrial applications. The latter
 proposes new models and architectures for database systems, and forms a
 growing part of internet-based uses.

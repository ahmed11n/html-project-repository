 The properties of a database are
 • Atomicity.
 • Consistency.
 • Isolation.
 • Durability.
 Atomicity:
 Atomicity in database ensures that the transactions are indivisible and irreducible where transactions either commit or abort. If a part of transaction fails then entire transaction fails.
 Consistency:
 Any change in the values of a database at particular instance are consistent with changes to other values. Consistency on any transaction acts as a predicate for the data which serves as
 • Precondition.
 • Postcondition.
 • Transformation condition.
 Isolation:
 Transaction in database ensures that the working transaction will not be changed or affected by any other transaction. In other words, modifications or updates made on one transaction is not viewed or changed by any other transaction. Isolation also ensures the effect of database is same when
 • Transactions are executed serially or
 • Executed in an interleaved fashion.
 Durability:
 Durability of the databases states that “once transaction has been committed, should remain in the same status” even in the case of failures such as
 • Power loss.
 • Database crash, etc.
